This is an extension of a prior assignment that is practice for various sorting 
algorithms (insertion sort and merge sort). In addition to implmentation, I've compared
the efficiency of the two alogrithms in various cases using the time it takes for the 
algorithm to sort. For example, I've confirmed that out of every sorting alogorithm, 
insertion sort works best when the list is already sorted in that order. In addition, 
I've also noticed that the state of the list does not matter when merge sort is used, and order
typically didn't change the result as well. When I used insertion and the descending version
immediately after, I was able to notice the time taken increase because we are in the worst case
scenario for the algorithm and (vice versa).
